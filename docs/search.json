RStudio is an “Integrated Development Environment (IDE)”, that is a software that provides a user-friendly interface for working with the R programming language. Note that it is possible to use other interface software, but RStudio is probably the most widely used today, and the one we will use during this training.\nIf, for one reason or another, it is not possible to install R or/and RStudio on your computer, you can temporarily use R / RStudio online by creating an account on the “Posit cloud”. However, we do not recommend this option for a long-term use as sensitive data should be stored on secured and personal servers.\nOnce R and RStudio are installed on your computer, you can directly open RStudio. It displays a nice console. You can create your first R script by clicking on the small white arrow on a green background and save it under the name 1Intro.R.",

    "section": "1.2 R, RStudio and the tidyverse",
    "text": "1.2 R, RStudio and the tidyverse\nR is a programming language developed since the 1990s. It is derived from the S language and also shares some similarities with the C language. It is open-source and free of charge.\nAmong the many strengths of R, it has a large community of users, who can also take on the role of developers who continuously contribute to improve R language and what it can do. R therefore has numerous extensions in the form of functions, stored in packages (or libraries), which greatly facilitate its use. The list of packages available on CRAN is available here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/. Although we will not be using them in this training seminar, please note that it is also possible to use packages that are not on CRAN.\nWith more than 22,000 packages, it’s easy to get lost. Throughout this guide, we will review a few packages that we considered helpful for making life easier when doing statistics in the social sciences. Again, let’s underline here that the goal of this guide is not to be exhaustive, nor to impose anything. One particularity of R is that it is often possible to do the same thing using different operations / functions / packages. Everyone eventually finds their own little “tricks”!\nThe tidyverse package includes a suite of packages designed to work together, making data manipulation, recoding, and the production of graphics easier compared to the basic R language, often referred to as “base R”. We will rely on functions and tools from the tidyverse package for our statistical work. You can have a look to the following small presentation of the tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nInstall the tidyverse package, then load it into the R session using the two lines of code below. You can copy-paste them into your script and run them (see the next section if you don’t know how to run lines of code).\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou only need to install packages once; however, you must load the package each time you open a new R session. So, if you close RStudio and then reopen it, there is no need to run install.packages(\"tidyverse\") again — but to use the functions from this package, you still need to load the tidyverse package by running the following code: library(tidyverse).\nCalling the relevant packages is generally done systematically at the beginning of the script.",

    "text": "1.3 RStudio as a working tool\nBy default, the console is displayed in the form of four panels:\n\nThe first panel in the top left corresponds to the R script file, which for now is empty (or almost empty, if you have already copy-pasted the lines of code to install and load tidyverse). This is where we will write the command lines that we will run, either by clicking the ‘Run’ button, or by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Enter (or Control + Enter).\nThe second panel in the bottom left corresponds to the console. For now, it simply tells us that it has loaded R in the most up-to-date version found on my computer (4.4.3). The console will display the commands that we have run and the messages returned by R when executing them.\nThe third panel in the top right contains several tabs. The most important one is the Environment tab, which shows all the objects created in the current session (data frames, lists, vectors, etc.).\nThe fourth panel in the bottom right also contains several tabs, including:\n\nFiles (which allows you to browse your computer’s directory structure),\nPlots (where our beautiful graphs will be displayed),\nPackages, which lists the packages (libraries) installed on our computer and indicates which ones are loaded in the current session (they are checked),\nHelp, which displays information about a function when you type ?function_name in the console,\nand Viewer, where our nice tables will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCheck that the tidyverse package is correctly installed and loaded in the R session.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RStudio console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\nWhen quitting RStudio, a window may appear asking whether you want to “Save the workspace image…”. Warning: in fact, it is not a good idea to click Save!\nBecause this saves the entire workspace (the session), which will be automatically reopened when restarting RStudio, and you may end up with objects (for example, old databases that you used for former projects) that are no longer relevant for a later session (and that may even conflict with one another).\nIf you did not click on ‘Save’, reopening RStudio resets the R session. To make sure this is really the case (clear the global environment, unload packages, reset memory, etc.), you can type the following code in the console:\n\n\n.rs.restartR()",

    "text": "1.4 Loading data into R\nTo do statistics, we need data. Here, we are going to use excerpts of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2019 collected by the Sri Lankan Department of Census and Statistics.\nFor legality matters, you will need to create an account on the Lanka data platform and download the microdata files from the online platform. Notice that you are able to download only 25% of the total survey sample.\nFor this workshop, we have additionally prepared three files to make your life easier to manipulate the survey, which you can access here Data repository. You will need to provide a password (request password by email!). Download the files from this online folder. The folder contains a PDF of the questionnaire and a zipped folder which you can unzip on your computer. In the zipped folder, you will find four “.rds” files (R statistical files):\n\ndemo.rds contains data from Section 1 of the survey, i.e. on demographic characteristics of all household members\nedu.rds contains data from Section 2 of the survey, i.e. on school education for household members aged 5 to 19\nhealth.rds contains data from Section 3A of the survey, i.e. on health treatment and chronic illness\nenvironment.rds contains data from Section 7 & 8, i.e. on access to primary facilities and housing information\n\nWARNING: The unit of analysis (a “row” in the data file) differs in the four different files. For demo.rds, a row in the data file refers to one household member, irrespective of their age (N=19,848). Within a household, each member has its own row. For edu.rds, one row also refers to one individual from a household, but this time there is an additional age restriction: only household individuals aged 5 to 19 (N=4,552). For health.rds , one row refers to one individual; even if there is no age restriction, the sample is smaller than demo.rds since some individuals did not answer questions related to health in the questionnaire (section 3A) (N=18,468). Finally, for environment.rds, one row refers to one household (and not to one individual, as it is the case in the other datasets) (N=4,982).\nIn addition to the variables (the different “columns” of the files) specific to each file, we have already added a number of socio-demographic variables in the files with data at the individual level (demo.rds, edu.rds and health.rds) to ease statistical manipulations, including:\n\nhhid: a unique household identifier (also available in environment.rds)\nindid: a unique individual identifier\nedu_attained: this is a recoded version of individual educational attainment\nedu_father: father’s educational attainment (only in edu.rds)\nedu_mother: mother’s educational attainment (only in edu.rds)\nedu_parent: combined parents’ educational attainment, i.e. maximum educational attainment between both parents (only in edu.rds)\nage: individual’s age\nbirth_year: individual’s year of birth\nsex: individual’s sex\nage_father: father’s age (only in edu.rds)\nage_mother: mother’s age (only in edu.rds)\nprovince: province of residence\nethnicity: household head’s ethnicity\nreligion: household head’s religion\nhhwealth: a continuous variable to proxy households’ material well-being (an index based on durable goods ownership which we constructed ourselves)\nhhwealthcat: a categorical variable to proxy households’ material well-being (an index based on durable goods ownership which we constructed ourselves)\nfinalweight_25per: a “survey weight” variable to use in all statistical treatments to get correct estimates!\n\nLet’s load edu.rds into RStudio. Generally, there are three options to import data into R:\n\nIn the bottom-right panel, you can browse your folder structure to find the appropriate file, and click on it.\nYou can click Import Dataset in the top-right panel, then click Browse and navigate through Finder or File Explorer.\nYou can directly use lines of code written in your script to load your file.\n\nThe third solution is preferable, in the interest of making your code reproducible. But the first or the second have the advantage of being easier when you are not familiar with coding, especially since these “point-and-click” solutions also provide the corresponding lines of code, which you can copy into your script for your next working session!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nLoad edu.rds using the first solution. Then, use the code below to directly use the second solution. Note that the line setwd(\"/home/groups/3genquanti/SoMix/HIES for workshop\") indicates where you have stored your files locally on your computer. You can retrieve the file path of your files in Finder or File Explorer by right-clicking on the data file, then selecting Properties or Get Info.\n\n\n\nsetwd(\"/home/groups/3genquanti/SoMix/HIES for workshop\")\nedu&lt;-readRDS(\"edu.rds\")",

    "text": "1.6 A few functions to manipulate data\n\n1.6.1 Accessing a variable\nThe dataset is therefore composed of 38 variables. To access a variable — for example the variable age — you can type:\n\nedu$age\n\nThe $ sign indicates that we are accessing the variable age contained in the edu dataset. This command returns a vector of the values of the variable.\nIn the tidyverse, we call objects using pipes, which come in two different (and largely equivalent) operators: %&gt;% and |&gt;. We will favor the second one (but they are largely interchangeable!).\nFor example, to calculate the mean of age, we would write:\n\nedu |&gt; summarise(mean(age))\n\nsummarise is the function that allows you to summarise the dataset according to the function specified. Note that we could also have written:\n\nedu |&gt; summarise(Mean_age=mean(age))\nedu |&gt; summarise(`Mean age`=mean(age))\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Transforming a variable\nLet’s assume the database does not include age but only year of birth (birth_year). In that case, we could create a variable returning individuals’ age using the information from the variable birth_year. Here, we use the function mutate to create/transform variables. Since the data that we use have been collected in 2019, we can then create a new variable that we decide to name ‘age_created’ to return individual’s age using the following code:\n\nedu &lt;- edu |&gt; mutate(age_created=2019-birth_year)\n\n\n\n1.6.3 Selecting columns\nTo create a database called edu2 where we select only certain variables from the initial database edu, we write:\n\nedu2&lt;- edu %&gt;% select(hhid,age,sex,edu_attained)\n\nselect allows to select only some columns (that is, some variables, as one column refers to one variable) of the dataframe.\nSimilarly, select can be used to remove columns:\n\nedu3 &lt;- edu2 |&gt; select(-c(edu_attained,sex))\n\n\n\n1.6.4 Selecting rows\nTo create a database from edu where we decide to study only male respondents:\n\nedum &lt;- edu |&gt; filter(sex==\"Male\")\n\nfilter allows you to select the rows of the dataset that satisfy a given condition (in this example, we keep only the rows for which the variable sex equals the modality “Male”; in other words, we keep only male respondents). The ampersand operator & means “and”. If you want to use the logical “or” operator, you write: |.\nLet’s say we want to study only female respondents with less than primary attainment:\n\nedufl&lt;- edu |&gt; filter(sex==\"Female\" & edu_attainment==\"Less than primary\")\n\n\n\n1.6.5 Renaming a variable\nLet’s rename a variable in edufl:\n\nedufl &lt;- edufl |&gt; rename(ethnic_category=ethnicity)\n\nThe variable ethnicity has been renamed as ethnic_category.",

    "section": "1.7 Saving data",
    "text": "1.7 Saving data\nTo save databases from R (because you have done some data management and want to save your file), there are several solutions.\n\n1.7.1 Native R formats\n\nYou can save your data in .RData format. This is the simplest option — no hassle — and the advantage is that you are sure to preserve the format of the variables, the labels (we will come back to this later), etc.\n\n\nsave(edufl,file=\"edufl.RData\")\n\nBefore using this function, we should not forget to run setwd(\"path to the folder where we want the file to be saved\") to indicate where to save the file (or at least to check that R is indeed pointing to the desired folder using the getwd() command).\nNote that the RData format can perfectly well be used to save several R objects in the same file:\n\nsave(edufl,edum,file=\"eduv2.RData\")\n\nTo reopen an .RData file, you simply need to write:\n\nload(\"eduv2.RData\")\n\nThe drawback of the .RData format is that, since there may be several objects in the file, we do not know what they are called and we cannot directly assign a default object name when opening it in the R console. This can sometimes be risky (imagine that we have a file eduv2.RData that contains edufl and edum, but that we already have an object called edum in our environment that is actually different — when opening eduv2.RData, the existing object would be overwritten).\nFor this reason, datasets can be saved individually using the .rds format with specific functions (this is how you have been provided with the workshop data):\n\nsaveRDS(edum, \"edum.rds\")\n\nWhen opening an .rds file, you explicitly control the name that will be assigned to it in the R environment (which in this case does not necessarily need to be edum):\n\nedum2 &lt;- readRDS(\"edum.rds\")\n\n\n\n1.7.2 CSV format\n\nWe sometimes need to export our data in CSV format. In that case, we use functions from the readr package, such as write_csv (which uses commas as column separators and periods as decimal markers).\n\nThe CSV format with comma separators is the international standard for CSV files, and it is easily formatted when Excel on one’s computer is configured in English:\n\nwrite_csv(edu, \"edu.csv\")\n\n\n\n1.7.3 Other formats\n\nIf you want to save your file directly as an Excel file, this is also possible. At least two packages allow this: writexl and openxlsx. If we install openxlsx (install.packages(\"openxlsx\")):\n\n\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nwrite.xlsx(edu, \"edu.xlsx\")\n\nIf you want to read an Excel file, you can use read.xlsx from the same package. Here, the argument sheet=NULL indicates that we are reading all the sheets of the Excel file if there are several:\n\nread.xlsx(\"Salaires.xlsx\", sheet = NULL)\n\n\nSometimes we work with colleagues who use other proprietary paid softwares (what an idea!). In that case, we can use the haven package, which allows to save data in SAS, SPSS or Stata format:\n\n\nlibrary(haven)\nwrite_dta(edu, \"edu.dta\")\nwrite_sas(edu, \"edu.sas7bdat\")\nwrite_sav(edu, \"edu.sav\")\n\nBe careful: with the SAS format, the conversion of value labels is not as straightforward as with other software.",

This sample, thanks to the household selection procedures included in the survey, is representative of the entire population of Sri Lanka.\nKeep in mind that the selection is based on a complete enumeration of households and a random selection of households included in the sample (in fact, it’s a little more complex, but that’s the general idea).\nWhy use a sample instead of surveying the entire population? Sampling allows the collection of high-quality, representative data at lower cost and in less time, and all public and private statistical institutes use this type of survey method.\nGenerally, sample data include a weight variable. These weights ensure the representativeness of the sample for the entire population, that is, in our case, of individuals living in Sri Lanka at the time of the survey. To put it simply, in the most common case, the weights correct biases in data collection because not all selected respondents were actually surveyed, and the weight corrects for these biases.\nThese types of data are very common in the social sciences (and the DCS conducts several sample-based surveys, such as the Time Use Survey, the Labor Force Survey, etc.), so it is important to know how to handle them.\nThus, all statistical operations performed on HIES files must take this weighting into account. For example, in the previous section we calculated the average age of respondents to the education module. Since we did not use a weight variable, we simply calculated the mean among the respondents. If we had taken weighting into account, we would have inferred the average age of children between 5 and 19 years old for the entire population.\nIn our HIES files, the correct variable weight variable is finalweight_25per (this is a specific weight variable to this sample because we are working with a 25% random sample of the survey sample, which is itself a random sample of the entire population).",

Indeed, the mean is sensitive to “extreme” values in a distribution.\nThe median is the value that separates the lower half from the upper half of a statistical distribution (50% of the population has a lower value, 50% has a higher value). When the mean and median differ greatly, it indicates that the distribution of the variable is not evenly spread around the mean.\nTypically, when studying income, the mean is often much higher than the median, while the median is a more stable measure of central tendency. This is because only a few individuals have very high incomes, which tends to increase the mean.\nTo obtain these statistics for the variable distance which indicates the distance from home to school for children:\n\nedu |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    min    = min(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = wtd.quantile(distance,probs=.5,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    max    = max(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_na   = sum(is.na(distance))\n  )\n\nNotice that we use finalweight_25per to calculate the mean and the median, but not to calculate the minimum and maximum. Here, the minimum and maximum suggest that some children live very close to their school, but for at least one child, the school is pretty far from home!\nThe mean is higher than the median, indicating that a few unusually high distance values are stretching the upper tail of the distribution, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.\nWe also added the number of NA cases in this variables, i.e. the number of missing variables. In fact, here this corresponds to children who actually do not attend school.\nWe produced such a nice output that we would like to display it as a table, but copying and pasting it from the console doesn’t look very nice…\nNo worries — there are plenty of packages in R to create beautiful table outputs. Here, we propose using kableExtra :\n\nsummary&lt;-edu |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    min    = min(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = wtd.quantile(distance,probs=.5,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    max    = max(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_na   = sum(is.na(distance))\n  )\nsummary |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n#Or to have a lower number of digits for the mean: \nsummary |&gt; kbl(digits=2) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\nThe function kbl transforms the summary object into a table in LaTeX/HTML format, which is displayed in the Viewer (bottom-right panel), and the function kable_classic is one of the default formatting options I chose.\nThese tables can be customized endlessly (including adding titles, captions, etc.). The main advantage is that they can be copied and pasted cleanly into your report, article, or thesis.\n\n\n\nTable created with kableExtra and displayed in the Viewer\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Summarizing a quantitative variable with a graph\nAll of this looks nice and seems to suggest that distance is a skewed variable with a distribution stretched to the right. Can we visualize the distribution of this variable?\nWe can use the esquisse package, which provides a point-and-click solution for creating plots. You need to run the following line (be a little patient while the page loads). This avoids having to write the code yourself to create the plot using the ggplot2 package.\n\nesquisser(edu)\n\nThis should load an interface with the different variables from the dataset at the top, which you will need to drag into the corresponding boxes.\n\n\n\nEsquisse interface\n\n\nBy dragging the distance variable into the X box, a histogram is created automatically. You can modify this representation, for example, by choosing a density plot instead. The entire graph is customizable using the options below.\nFinally, you can save your plot and also copy the code that generates the same plot without having to reopen Esquisse!",

This is useful as we always want to have weighted percentages, but the unweighted number of individuals on which this percentage has been calculated: indeed, statistics tends to be less robust when they are calculated on small subsamples, so it is always interesting to keep in mind the number of respondents available in our (sub)sample.\nHere, we are interested in the variable r2_school_education, which corresponds to the respondents’ school status.\n\n#|eval: false\n\nedu |&gt; freqtable(r2_school_education,weights=finalweight_25per) %&gt;% freq()\nedu |&gt; freqtable(r2_school_education) %&gt;% freq()\nedu |&gt; freqtable(r2_school_education,weights=finalweight_25per) %&gt;% freq() %&gt;% select(-n)",

    "text": "3.1 The association between a categorical variable and a numerical variable\nIn section 2 on univariate statistics, we discussed several indicators of the distribution of a numerical variable (minimum, maximum, mean, median). Thanks to the lines of code already set up, it is easy to calculate these statistics for different categories of another categorical variable.\nYou simply need to add another function to compute these statistics for each category of a variable, namely group_by:\nedu |&gt;\n  group_by(province) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    min    = min(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = wtd.quantile(distance,probs=.5,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    max    = max(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_na   = sum(is.na(distance))\n  )\nLet’s study the distance to school according to the place of residence: urban, rural, or estate. This corresponds to the variable sector, with categories 1, 2, and 3. We can recode these categories using the icut() interface, or directly with the following code:\nedu$sector_rec &lt;- edu$sector  |&gt;\n  as.character() |&gt;\n  fct_recode(\n    \"Urban\" = \"1\",\n    \"Rural\" = \"2\",\n    \"Estate\" = \"3\"\n  )\n\nedu |&gt;\n  group_by(sector_rec) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    min    = min(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = wtd.quantile(distance,probs=.5,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    max    = max(distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_na   = sum(is.na(distance))\n  )\nWe can analyse how the distance to school varies across multiple categorical variables. For example, we can compute the mean and the median with respect to both the province and the place of residence:\nedu |&gt;\n  group_by(province,sector_rec) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = wtd.quantile(distance,probs=.5,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  kbl(digits=1) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\nThe distance to school tends to be higher in rural areas, and this difference is mainly driven by extreme values. Indeed, it is primarily the mean, which is more sensitive to large values, that reflects this gap, more so than the median.\nedu |&gt;\n  group_by(province,sector_rec) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    mean   = wtd.mean(distance,weights=finalweight_25per,na.rm = TRUE) \n  ) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from=sector_rec,values_from=mean) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Urban-Rural difference`=Urban-Rural) |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=1) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\nWe can clearly see from this last analysis that this pattern holds in all provinces (except North Western), but the gap varies: it is higher in the Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces, where the distance to school for children in estate areas is particularly pronounced.",

    "text": "3.2 The association between two categorical variables and the cross-tabulation\n\n3.2.1 Some conventions for cross-tabulations\nWe now come to cross-tabulations to study the associations between two categorical variables.\nFirst, let’s recall a few analysis conventions. It’s easy to get confused when creating cross-tabulations, so keep the following points in mind:\n\nWhat is my response variable (also called dependent variable), i.e., the variable assumed to depend on another factor or, in other words, the variable that we want to explain?\nWhat is my independent variable, i.e., the variable assumed to have an effect on the dependent variable?\n\nHere, we can for example make the assumption that attending school (variable r2_school_education) depends on different variables such as the parents’ level of education, but also parental economic status, the place of residence, etc.\nTo visualize whether a factor affects a dependent variable, we can create a cross-tabulation in which:\n\nThe dependent variable is placed in the columns.\nThe independent variable is placed in the rows.\nRow percentages are calculated (we need to normalize the row counts to compare them!).\nWe then compare the rows within the same column.\n\nOf course, this is theory.\nThere are many cases where we might be more interested in column percentages, or even total percentages, or we may want to swap rows and columns. Nevertheless, keeping these simple conventions in mind helps to stay oriented when navigating statistical analyses.\n\n\n3.2.2 A practical application of the cross-tabulation\nLet’s try to do some cross-tabulations then. We again use the functions from the questionr package. To create a cross-tabulation of unweighted counts, we can write:\n\nedu$r2_school_education_rec &lt;- edu$r2_school_education  |&gt;\n  as.character() |&gt;\n  fct_recode(\n    \"Currently attending\" = \"1\",\n    \"Never attended\" = \"2\",\n    \"Attended school in the past\" = \"3\"\n  )\n\nedu |&gt; freqtable(sector_rec,r2_school_education_rec) |&gt;\n  kbl() |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nFrequency cross-tabulation\n\n\nThe row variable (here edu_parents) is the independent variable — it is written first — while the column variable (here r2_school_education_rec) is the dependent variable.\nThe table of counts is useful because it shows that some cells contain relatively small numbers of observations, which should make us cautious when interpreting the corresponding rows/columns.\nTo obtain total percentages (joint percentages):\n\nedu |&gt; freqtable(sector_rec,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  prop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=1) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nJoint percentages\n\n\nFrom this table, we can say that the most frequent combination of residential location and children’s schooling status is children living in rural areas who are currently enrolled in school (68% of all children).\nWe can also compute column percentages:\n\nedu |&gt; freqtable(sector_rec,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  cprop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=1) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nColumn percentages\n\n\nHere, we see that among children who are currently in school, 79% live in rural areas (and 79% of all children, regardless of schooling status, live in rural areas).\nAmong children who have never attended school, 83% live in rural areas. Children from rural areas are therefore slightly over-represented among those who have never attended school.\nConversely, they are slightly under-represented among children who are not currently enrolled but have been enrolled in the past (78%).\nFinally, row percentages make interpretation easier when assessing whether there is an association between residential location and schooling:\n\nedu |&gt; freqtable(sector_rec,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=1) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nRow percentages\n\n\nHere, we see that, regardless of residential location, the most frequent situation for children is to be currently enrolled in school.\nOnly 3% of children have never attended school, and this configuration is slightly less common in urban areas and estates. In other words, never having attended school — a very marginal situation overall — is mainly a rural phenomenon.\n\nSalaires |&gt; freqtable(race,salaire_quint) |&gt; prop(n=T,digit=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nStudy the association between age and school attendance with a row percentage cross tabulation.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 From the table to the graphic\nEsquisse can again in these cases be used to represent graphically the association between residence and school attendance. Here, our category of interest is specifically “never attending school”.\nYou first need to store the row-percentage tabulation (transformed as a “data.frame” using the as.data.frame() function) in an object (rtab), then open esquisser with this specific command.\n\nrtab&lt;-edu |&gt; freqtable(sector_rec,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() |&gt; as.data.frame() \nesquisser(rtab)\n\nYou can then drop the residence variable on the X-axis tab and Freq in the Y-axis tab. Using the “Data” section at the bottom, remove all the categories of the r2_school_education_rec variable, except “Never attending school”. You can further refine the graphic by increasing the font, changing the axis labels, adding a title…\n\n\n\nNever attending school children\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Cross-tabulation with three variables?\nVery often, we study social processes that depend on multiple social factors. For instance, school attendance may vary according to age (see above exercise), but age may impact differently school attendance for male and female children.\n\nOne first easy solution to study this is simply to filter the row percentage cross tabulations according to the different categories of a third variable (here, sex).\n\nFor instance:\n\nedu |&gt; \n  filter(sex==\"Male\") |&gt;\n  freqtable(age,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=0) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\nedu |&gt; \n  filter(sex==\"Female\") |&gt;\n  freqtable(age,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=0) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n \nThis code prints successively two crosstabs in the Viewer panel, but it is not ideal as we would want to see them on the same page.\n\nA second relatively easy solution is to create a new variable concatenating together the variables sex and age (individuals are simultaneously characterized by both of these dimensions) and to use it as the independent variable, thanks to the interaction function:\n\n\nedu &lt;- edu |&gt;\n  mutate(agef=factor(age),#make sure age is well ordered\n         sex_age=interaction(sex,agef,sep=\" \")) #concatenate age and sex together\nedu |&gt; \n  freqtable(sex_age,r2_school_education_rec,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() |&gt;\n  kbl(digits=0) |&gt; kable_classic(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nCross tabulation with three variables\n\n\n\nThird, we can actually also simply write:\n\n\ntab3&lt;-edu |&gt; \n  freqtable(age,r2_school_education_rec,sex,weights=finalweight_25per) |&gt;\n  lprop() \ntab3\n\ntab3 contains the three-way cross tabulation. We have simply added the sex variable after the dependent within the freqtable() function.\nUnfortunately, viewing this bigger table in the Viewer panel is not so straightforward with the existing kableExtra functions. One solution is to create our own function that we will be able to use at any time whenever we want to study a 3-way cross tabulation.\nRun the following code which will create the kbl_grouped_3way() function:\n\nkbl_grouped_3way &lt;- function(tab, digits = 1) {\n  \n  # Convert to a dataframe without dropping: NA conservés\n  df &lt;- as.data.frame(tab, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, drop = FALSE)\n  \n  # Identify the three dimensions\n  dims &lt;- names(df)[names(df) != \"Freq\"]\n  dim1 &lt;- dims[1]   # ligne\n  dim2 &lt;- dims[2]   # colonne\n  dim3 &lt;- dims[3]   # groupe\n  \n  # To character\n  df[ dims ] &lt;- lapply(df[ dims ], function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), NA, as.character(x)))\n  \n  # Pivot wider\n  df_wide &lt;- df |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_wider(\n      names_from = all_of(dim2),\n      values_from = Freq,\n      values_fill = 0\n    )\n  \n  # Keep order\n  grouping_var &lt;- df_wide[[dim3]]\n  \n  # Construct kable\n  tab_out &lt;- df_wide |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(-all_of(dim3)) |&gt;\n    kbl(digits = digits)\n  \n  # Group levels (including NA)\n  group_levels &lt;- unique(grouping_var)\n  \n  # Line index by group\n  groups &lt;- split(seq_len(nrow(df_wide)),\n                  f = ifelse(is.na(grouping_var), \"NA\", grouping_var))\n  \n  # Pack_rows for each group in kable\n  for (g in names(groups)) {\n    rows &lt;- groups[[g]]\n    tab_out &lt;- tab_out |&gt;\n      pack_rows(group = g,\n                start_row = min(rows),\n                end_row = max(rows))\n  }\n  \n  tab_out\n}\n\nThen, just apply to the tab3 object:\n\nkbl_grouped_3way(m,digits=0) |&gt;\n    kable_classic_2(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nSchool attendance by age and sex\n\n\nOf course, it is also possible to produce a figure, which could for instance look like this:\n\n\n\nGraphic of the school attendance by age and sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nStudy how the association between age and school attendance vary by residence locality (urban, rural and estate).",

Do not forget unweighted frequencies, missing observations, …\nSave the tables/graphics in a relevant document.\nIf some variables require recoding tasks, justify and run them.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nConduct bivariate or multivariate statistics. This may include mean/standard deviation by a categorical variable, cross tabulations, graphics…\nSave your code and your analysis!\n\nAfter carefully discussing among yourself and with your tutors about the most interesting outputs of these analyses, write analytical sentences describing your analyses.\nIn a further step, you will need to enhance these analyses in different ways in terms of sociological interpretation:\n\nHow do these results contradict or support your reasoning before conducting these statistical analysis?\nWhat is new in your results that you did not know before, confirms or contradicts the sociological literature, etc?\nWhat could possibly be done in terms of qualitative study to push further these analyses?",

    "text": "6.1 What is a “project” in RStudio?\nThroughout this tutorial, we have created various R scripts that have been collected in a folder called “R Training.” When you code in R, a good practice is to create a “project” that points to the folder containing scripts that are related to each other (a research project, for example), the relevant data, etc.\nThis project folder can be created by clicking on “Project: (None)” in the top right corner, then on “New Project”, and finally “Existing Directory” (select the Training R folder).\nThis folder can contain several files:\nThe advantage of working on a “project” in RStudio is that Rstudio will then automatically point to the root folder (R Training) when the project is opened, making it easier to access files in Files and by writing the path in scripts.",

It will be very useful to help you find your way around and understand your code when you come back to it after some time - when you have completely forgotten what you were doing!:\n\n#The hash symbol allows you to start a comment.\n# When you need to write a long comment,\n# you can write without the hash symbol, then highlight everything,\n# and press Cmd (or Ctrl)+Shift+C, and the block will be turned into\n# a comment!\n\nIt is also quite common to create different scripts for different types of operations (but this depends on your habits), for example:\n\nA script (or several scripts) where you perform all the recoding necessary for analysis and save your database with the new variables (in R format, rds rather).\nA script (or several scripts) where you perform all the analysis operations.\n\nAnother good practice that we strongly recommend you to do is to keep track of your the progress of your work by saving a new file - with the date indicated in the title - each new day you are working on a script. For example, the recoding file could be named “20250602Recodages.R” (the date is in YYYYMMDD format to ensure that the files are displayed from oldest to newest in the folder where they are stored).",
