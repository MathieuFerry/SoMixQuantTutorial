It will be very useful to help you find your way around and understand your code when you come back to it after some time - when you have completely forgotten what you were doing!:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#The hash symbol allows you to start a comment.\n# When you need to write a long comment,\n# you can write without the hash symbol, then highlight everything,\n# and press Cmd (or Ctrl)+Shift+C, and the block will be turned into\n# a comment!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIt is also quite common to create different scripts for different types of operations (but this depends on your habits), for example:\n\n-   A script (or several scripts) where you perform all the recoding necessary for analysis and save your database with the new variables (in R format, rds rather).\n\n-   A script (or several scripts) where you perform all the analysis operations.\n\nAnother **good practice** that we strongly recommend you to do is to keep track of your the progress of your work by saving a new file - with the date indicated in the title - each new day you are working on a script. For example, the recoding file could be named “20250602Recodages.R” (the date is in YYYYMMDD format to ensure that the files are displayed from oldest to newest in the folder where they are stored).\n\n## Get help\n\nHere are a few ways to get help when the script crashes:\n\n-   The first reflex is to look up how to use a function in R:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?mean #The question mark opens the function description page.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   You can also type your problem directly on internet (for example on Google, etc.). This will often get you to the Stackoverflow forum (among others) where the problem you are facing has been discussed (usually in English).\n\n-   You can also look into various R training guides (for example, the one mentioned in the preface section of this tutorial).\n\n-   ...\n\n## How to merge distinct statistical files?\n\n**MATHIEU ==\\> DO WE WANT TO GET INTO THIS? MAYBE NOT?**\n\nNous n'avons pas ici parlé de la jointure de différents fichiers statistiques, opération pourtant courante. Cette page de utilitR est très complète pour mener ces opérations sans trop se prendre la tête : <https://book.utilitr.org/03_Fiches_thematiques/Fiche_joindre_donnees.html>.\n\n## Variable and value labels\n\n**MATHIEU ==\\> DO WE WANT TO GET INTO THIS? MAYBE NOT?**\n\nEnfin, nous avons ici travaillé à partir de variables qui n'ont pas d'étiquettes et dont les modalités des variables catégorielles n'ont pas de labels. C'est pourtant possible (voire courant, si on charge un fichier Stata dans R) et plutôt pratique :\n\n-   On a ainsi des étiquettes déjà prêtes pour les tableaux / graphiques\n\n-   On va bien plus vite dans le recodage et surtout on évite les erreurs (recoder 1 en 3 va plus vite et comprend moins de risque d'erreur que recoder \"Cadres et professions scientifiques\" en \"Classes supérieures\").\n\nOn se reportera aux Chapitres [11](https://larmarange.github.io/guide-R/manipulation/etiquettes-variables.html) et [12](https://larmarange.github.io/guide-R/manipulation/etiquettes-valeurs.html) de guide-R qui introduisent à ces concepts et leur usage.\n\n## Exercices\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercice\" icon=\"false\"}\nCréer un Projet pointant sur le dossier de la Formation R. Commenter et créer des sections dans l'un de ses scripts. Pas facile ? D'où l'intérêt de le faire au fur et à mesure :)\n:::\n",
