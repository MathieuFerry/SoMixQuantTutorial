It will be very useful to help you find your way around and understand your code when you come back to it after some time - when you have completely forgotten what you were doing!:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#The hash symbol allows you to start a comment.\n# When you need to write a long comment,\n# you can write without the hash symbol, then highlight everything,\n# and press Cmd (or Ctrl)+Shift+C, and the block will be turned into\n# a comment!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIt is also quite common to create different scripts for different types of operations (but this depends on your habits), for example:\n\n-   A script (or several scripts) where you perform all the recoding necessary for analysis and save your database with the new variables (in R format, rds rather).\n\n-   A script (or several scripts) where you perform all the analysis operations.\n\nAnother **good practice** that we strongly recommend you to do is to keep track of your the progress of your work by saving a new file - with the date indicated in the title - each new day you are working on a script. For example, the recoding file could be named “20250602Recodages.R” (the date is in YYYYMMDD format to ensure that the files are displayed from oldest to newest in the folder where they are stored).\n\n## Get help\n\nHere are a few ways to get help when the script crashes:\n\n-   The first reflex is to look up how to use a function in R:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?mean #The question mark opens the function description page.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   You can also type your problem directly on internet (for example on Google, etc.). This will often get you to the Stackoverflow forum (among others) where the problem you are facing has been discussed (usually in English).\n\n-   You can also look into various R training guides (for example, the one mentioned in the preface section of this tutorial).\n\n-   ...\n\n",
