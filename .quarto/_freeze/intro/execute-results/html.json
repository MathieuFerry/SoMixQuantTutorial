RStudio is an \"Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\", meaning software that provides a user-friendly interface for working with the R programming language. Note that it is possible to use other interface software, but RStudio is probably the most widely used today.\n\nIf, for one reason or another, it is not possible to install R / RStudio on your computer, you can temporarily (because we do not recommend using a private server to store sensitive data) use R / RStudio online by creating an account on the [\"Posit cloud\"](https://login.posit.cloud/login?redirect=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fposit.cloud%252Flogin%26client_id%3Dposit-cloud%26response_type%3Dcode%26show_auth%3D0&product=cloud).\n\nOnce R and RStudio are installed, you can directly open RStudio, which will display a nice console (except that here, I have already created an R script by clicking on the small white arrow on a green background and saved it under the name 1Intro.R, which you should also do).\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\n-   Open RStudio and create an empty script.\n\n-   Save this script in a folder (for example, “Formation R”), naming it for instance 1Intro.R.\n:::\n\n## R, RStudio and the tidyverse\n\nYou can refer to the following [small presentation](https://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/DS_Workshop_Intro_R/slides/3a_tidyverse.html) of the tidyverse. Let us recall here that R is a programming language developed since the 1990s, derived from the S language, and sharing some similarities with the C language. It is open-source and free of charge.\n\nAmong the many strengths of R, one can note in particular its community of users, who can also take on the role of developers. R therefore has numerous extensions in the form of functions, stored in packages (or libraries), which greatly facilitate its use. The list of packages available on CRAN (although it is also possible to use packages that are not on CRAN) is available here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/>.\n\nWith more than 22,000 packages, it’s easy to get lost. Throughout this guide, we suggest using a few packages considered helpful for making life easier when doing statistics in the social sciences. Again, the goal is not to be exhaustive, nor to impose anything. One particularity of R is that it is often possible to do the same thing using different operations / functions / packages. Everyone eventually finds their own little \"tricks\"!\n\nThe tidyverse package actually includes a suite of packages designed to work together, making data manipulation, recoding, and the production of graphics easier compared to “base R”. We will rely on it here for our statistical work.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nInstall the tidyverse package, then load it into the R session using the two lines of code below. You can copy-paste them into your script and run them (see the next section if you don’t know how to run lines of code).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nYou only need to install packages once; however, you must load the package each time you open a new R session. So, if you close RStudio and then reopen it, there is no need to run `install.packages(\"tidyverse\")` again — but to use the functions from this package, you still need to call tidyverse by running `library(tidyverse)`.\n\nCalling the relevant packages is generally done systematically at the beginning of the script.\n:::\n\n## RStudio as a working tool\n\nBy default, the console is displayed in the form of four panels:\n\n-   The first panel in the top left corresponds to the R script file, which for now is empty (or almost empty, if you have already copy-pasted the lines of code to install and load tidyverse). This is where we will write the command lines that we will run, either by clicking Run, or by using the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Enter (or Control + Enter).\n\n-   The second panel in the bottom left corresponds to the console. For now, it simply tells us that it has loaded R in the most up-to-date version found on my computer (4.4.3). The console will display the commands that we have run and the messages returned by R when executing them.\n\n-   The third panel in the top right contains several tabs. The most important one is the Environment tab, which shows all the objects created in the current session (data frames, lists, vectors, etc.).\n\n-   The fourth panel in the bottom right also contains several tabs, including Files — which allows you to browse your computer’s directory structure — Plots, where our beautiful graphs will be displayed, Packages, which lists the packages (libraries) installed on our computer and indicates which ones are loaded in the current session (they are checked), Help, which displays information about a function when you type `?function_name` in the console, and Viewer, where our nice tables will appear.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nCheck that the tidyverse package is correctly installed and loaded in the R session.\n:::\n\n![The RStudio console](images/clipboard-343351687.png)\n\n::: callout-caution\n-   When quitting RStudio, a window may appear asking whether you want to “Save the workspace image…”. And in fact, it is not a good idea to click Save!\n\n-   Because this saves the entire workspace (the session), which will be automatically reopened when restarting RStudio, and you may end up with objects that are no longer relevant for a later session (and that may even conflict with one another).\n\n-   If you did not click Save, reopening RStudio resets the R session. To make sure this is really the case (clear the global environment, unload packages, reset memory, etc.), you can type the following in the console:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n.rs.restartR()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Loading data into R\n\nTo do statistics, we need data. Here, we are going to use excerpts of the [Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2019](https://www.statistics.gov.lk/IncomeAndExpenditure/StaticalInformation) collected by the Sri Lankan Department of Census and Statistics. For legality matters, you will need to create an account on the [Lanka data platform](https://nada.statistics.gov.lk/index.php/home) and download the microdata files from the online platform. Notice that you are able to download only 25% of the total survey sample. \n\nFor this workshop, we have additionally prepared three files to make your life easier to manipulate the survey, which you can access here [Data repository](https://forms.gle/tkBxwuPQtSvmfT9o7). You will need to provide a password (request password by email!). Download the files from this online folder. The folder contains a PDF of the questionnaire and a zipped folder which you can unzip on your computer. In the zipped folder, you will find three \".rds\" files (R statistical files): \n- `edu.rds` contains data from Section 2 of the survey, i.e. on school education for household members aged 5 to 19\n- `health.rds` contains data from Section 3A of the survey, i.e. on health treatment and chronic illness\n- `environment.rds` contains data from Section 7 & 8, i.e. on access to primary facilities and housing information\n\nNotice that the unit of analysis differs in the three different files. For `edu.rds`, the unit of analysis (a \"row\" in the data file) are all household individuals aged 5 to 19 (N=4,552). For `health.rds` and `environment.rds`, the \n\nIn addition the variables (the different \"columns\" of the files) of these sections, we have already added a number of socio-demographic variables in each of these files to ease statistical manipulations, including: \n- `hhid`: a unique household identifier\n- `indid`: a unique individual identifier (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `edu_attained`: this is a recoded version of individual educational attainment\n- `edu_father`: father's educational attainment (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `edu_mother`: mother's educational attainment (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `edu_parent`: combined parents' educational attainment, i.e. maximum educational attainment between both parents (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `age`: individual's age (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `birth_year`: individual's age (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `sex`: individual's sex (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `age_father`: father's age (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `age_mother`: mother's age (only in `edu.rds`)\n- `province`: province of residence\n- `ethnicity`: household head's ethnicity\n- `religion`: household head's religion\n- `hhwealth`: a continuous variable to proxy households' material well-being (an index based on durable goods ownership)\n- `hhwealthcat`: a categorical variable to proxy households' material well-being (an index based on durable goods ownership)\n- `finalweight_25per`: a \"survey weight\" variable to use in all statistical treatments to get correct estimates!\n\nLet's load `edu.rds` into RStudio. Generally, there are three options to import data into R:\n- In the bottom-right panel, you can browse your folder structure to find the appropriate file, and click on it.\n- You can click Import Dataset in the top-right panel, then click Browse and navigate through Finder or File Explorer.\n- You can directly use lines of code written in your script to load your file.\n\nThe third solution is preferable, in the interest of making your code reproducible. But the first or the second have the advantage of being easier when you are not familiar with coding, especially since these “point-and-click” solutions also provide the corresponding lines of code, which you can copy into your script for your next working session!\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nLoad `edu.rds` using the first solution. Then, use the code below to directly use the second solution. Note that the line `setwd(\"/home/groups/3genquanti/SoMix/HIES for workshop\")` indicates where you have stored your files locally on your computer. You can retrieve the file path of your files in Finder or File Explorer by right-clicking on the data file, then selecting Properties or Get Info.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"/home/groups/3genquanti/SoMix/HIES for workshop\")\nedu<-readRDS(\"edu.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Describing your dataset\n\nIf everything worked properly, the dataset should now appear in the Environment (top-right tab).\n\nTo see the data file (you can also click on it): \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(edu)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral ways of better describing your dataset can be useful:\n\n-   You can type the name of the dataset `edu` in the console, which will display the dataset (not recommended!).\n\n-   You can also type `str(edu)` to understand the structure of the dataset.\n\n-   You can also type `summary(edu)` to obtain a summary of the quantitative variables in the dataset.\n\n## A few functions to manipulate data\n\n### Accessing a variable\n\nThe dataset is therefore composed of 38 variables. To access a variable — for example the variable age — you can type:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu$age\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `$` sign indicates that we are accessing the variable age contained in the edu dataset. This command returns a vector of the values of the variable.\n\nIn the tidyverse, we call objects using pipes, which come in two different (and largely equivalent) operators: `%>%` and `|>`. We will aim to favor the second one (but they are largely interchangeable!).\n\nFor example, to calculate the mean of age, we would write:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu |> summarise(mean(age))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`summarise` is the function that allows you to summarise the dataset according to the function specified. Note that we could also have written:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu |> summarise(Mean_age=mean(age))\nedu |> summarise(`Mean age`=mean(age))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Transforming a variable\n\nLet's assume the database does not include age but only birth_year. In that case, we could re-create age by creating a variable based on birth_year. Here, we use mutate to create/transform variables. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu <- edu |> mutate(age_created=2019-birth_year)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Selecting columns\n\nTo create a database called `edu2` where we select only certain variables, we write:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu2<- edu %>% select(hhid,age,sex,edu_attained)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`select` allows to select columns of the dataframe. \n\nSimilarly, `select` can be used to remove columns: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedu3 <- edu2 |> select(-c(edu_attained,sex))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Selecting rows\n\nTo create a database from `edu` where we decide to study only male respondents: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedum <- edu |> filter(sex==\"Male\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`filter` allows you to select the rows of the dataset that satisfy a given condition. The ampersand operator `&` means \"and\". If you want to use the logical \"or\" operator, you write: `|`.\n\nLet's say we want to study only female respondents with less than primary attainment:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedufl<- edu |> filter(sex==\"Female\" & edu_attainment==\"Less than primary\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Renaming a variable\n\nLet's rename a variable in `edufl`: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedufl <- edufl |> rename(ethnic_category=ethnicity)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe variable `ethnicity` has been renamed as `ethnic_category`. \n\n## Saving data\n\nTo save databases from R (because you have done some data management and want to save your file), there are several solutions. \n\n### Native R formats\n\n-   You can save your data in .RData format. This is the simplest option — no hassle — and the advantage is that you are sure to preserve the format of the variables, the labels (we will come back to this later), etc.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave(edufl,file=\"edufl.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBefore using this function, we should not forget to run `setwd(\"path to the folder where the file will be saved\")` to indicate where to save the file (or at least to check that R is indeed pointing to the desired folder using the `getwd()` command).\n\nNote that the RData format can perfectly well be used to save several R objects in the same file:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave(edufl,edum,file=\"eduv2.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo reopen an .RData file, you simply need to write:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(\"eduv2.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe drawback of the .RData format is that, since there may be several objects in the file, we do not know what they are called and we cannot directly assign a default object name when opening it in the R console. This can sometimes be risky (imagine that we have a file eduv2.RData that contains edufl and edum, but that we already have an object called edum in our environment that is actually different — when opening eduv2.RData, the existing object would be overwritten).\n\nFor this reason, datasets can be saved individually using the .rds format with specific functions (this is how you have been provided with the workshop data):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsaveRDS(edum, \"edum.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen opening an .rds file, you explicitly control the name that will be assigned to it in the R environment (which in this case does not necessarily need to be `edum`):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedum2 <- readRDS(\"edum.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### CSV format\n\n-   We sometimes need to export our data in CSV format. In that case, we use functions from the readr package, such as `write_csv` (which uses commas as column separators and periods as decimal markers).\n\nThe CSV format with comma separators is the international standard for CSV files, and it is easily formatted when Excel on one's computer is configured in English:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_csv(edu, \"edu.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Other formats\n\n-   If you want to save your file directly as an Excel file, this is also possible. At least two packages allow this: writexl and openxlsx. If we install openxlsx (`install.packages(\"openxlsx\")`):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nwrite.xlsx(edu, \"edu.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to read an Excel file, you can use read.xlsx from the same package. Here, the argument sheet = NULL indicates that we are reading all the sheets of the Excel file if there are several:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.xlsx(\"Salaires.xlsx\", sheet = NULL)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Sometimes we work with colleagues who use other proprietary paid software (what an idea!). In that case, we can use the haven package, which allows us to save data in SAS, SPSS or Stata format:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(haven)\nwrite_dta(edu, \"edu.dta\")\nwrite_sas(edu, \"edu.sas7bdat\")\nwrite_sav(edu, \"edu.sav\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n*Be careful: with the SAS format, the conversion of value labels is not as straightforward as with other software.*\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\n\nSave as an .rds file a dataset created from edu with the following conditions:\n\n    -   It contains only the columns hhid, edu_attained, age, and sex.\n\n    -   It contains only individuals who, at the time of the survey, are not in school (r2_school_education %in% c(2, 3)).\n\n:::\n",
