# Preface {.unnumbered}

This short guide summarizes the learning elements proposed for the SoMix training in December 2025 in Colombo (Sri Lanka).

The various tutorials aim to familiarize participants with the RStudio console, the R language (and the tidyverse) through a selection of functions and tools considered most relevant for handling statistical data in the social sciences.

This guide is a training support for R; it is not a full course in statistics. It is also not intended to replace the many excellent guides available on the internet, for example:
